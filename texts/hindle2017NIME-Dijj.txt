ABSTRACT
The didgeridoo is a wind instrument composed of a single
large tube often used as drone instrument for backing up the
mids and lows of an ensemble. A didgeridoo is played by
buzzing the lips and blowing air into the didgeridoo. To play
a didgeridoo continously one can employ circular breathing
but the volume of air required poses a real challenge to
novice players. In this paper we replace the expense of
circular breathing and lip buzzing with electronic excitation,
thus creating an electro-acoustic didgeridoo or electronic
didgeridoo. Thus we describe the didgeridoo excitation
signal, how to replicate it, and the hardware necessary
to make an electro-acoustic didgeridoo driven by speakers
and controllable from a computer. To properly drive
the didgeridoo we rely upon 4th-order ported bandpass
speaker boxes to help guide our excitation signals into
an attached acoustic didgeridoo. The results somewhat
replicate human didgeridoo playing, enabling a new kind
of mid to low electro-acoustic accompaniment without the
need for circular breathing.

INTRODUCTION

The didgeridoo is an ancient instrument heralding from
the indigenous Australians, Aboriginal Australians, and
Torres Strait Islanders. Originally fashioned from termitehollowed out branches of trees [3], the didgeridoo is a
long low frequency wind instrument that is driven by
buzzing one’s lips. It can be played continuously by human
players if circular breathing is employed. The didgeridoo
typically produces long drones, but one can also speak
into it and modulate the frequency of buzzing and breath
to play various motifs similar to animal sounds found in
Australia [4].
Circular breathing [1] is the act of continuously pushing
air out of the mouth by the use of lungs, diaphragm, and

even cheek muscles. Circular breathers will lock their mouth
cavity down, breath through their nose, and push air out of
their mouths mechanically with their cheeks. This enables
the circular breather to continuously refresh their air supply
and not run out of air. The level of skill required to drive
a didgeridoo is more than what is required to drive smaller
wind instruments. Circular breathing is a difficult skill to
learn for many novices, especially the authors of this paper.
Thus the main motivation for this work comes from the
fact that both of the authors are didgeridoo novices, and
they find the large volume of air that a didgeridoo requires
to be too much for their weak circular breathing skills.
Out of desperation and need to play acoustic long drones,
combined with a lack of enthusiasm for skillful training and
practice, the authors attempted to automate some forms of
didgeridoo playing.
This work has 3 requirements: play a didgeridoo automatically without a human respiratory system; play a didgeridoo acoustically—do not synthesize the resonant chamber
of the didgeridoo, rather drive it; and to drive a didgeridoo
electronically such that it sounds like a real didgeridoo.
The authors experimented haphazardly to drive a didgeridoo much like a bagpipe, by driving a tube with compressed
air, air from balloons, and air from pumps. The authors
found that the buzzing lips of the didgeridoo player were
not appropriately modelled by these attempts and, consequently, did not sound like a didgeridoo. Thus the authors
embarked down a path of electronically exciting didgeridoo
with speakers that played a signal that closely replicated the
buzzing of a didgeridoo player’s lips. Other works [8] have
driven wind instruments with speakers, drivers, and tweeters and have had some success, so why not try didgeridoos?
Driving a didgeridoo requires a different approach than
driving a clarinet as the frequency of the excitation signal
is much lower than that of clarinets and other smaller wind
instruments. We employ speaker box design to address this
need for low frequency response from excitation signals.
In this paper, we provide the following contributions:
• we present a method of electronically exciting a
didgeridoo with speakers;
• we describe the design of speaker boxes necessary to
drive a didgeridoo;
• we have performed, tested, refined, and analyzed this
design;

PRIOR WORK

To drive a didgeridoo with a speaker we need to emulate the
noise made by a human player. The didgeridoo excitation
signal was described and modelled by Fletcher et al. [3].
This model uses frequency, time, and lip opening as inputs
and produces a sound wave that can excite a didgeridoo. We
provide a detailed description of this model in Section 3.2.

222

The Monochord-Aerophone Robotic Instrument Ensemble [8] used high frequency driver-excited clarinets and wind
intstruments during live performances. Their clarinet has
solenoid driven “fingers” and can play many pitches, however, unfortunately the tone is robotic. The tweeter drivers
used in the instrument make it inappropriate for driving a
didgeridoo as they are too high pitched.
Not all attempts at driving wind instruments used speakers. Some have tried to drive wind instruments with air
pressure control systems that pump air out of robots. The
biologically inspired performance robots described by Solis
et al. [9] force air into wind instruments like flutes.
Michon et al. [5] developed the hybrid clarinet. It has a
human driven mouth piece with an electronically modelled
clarinet. They attempted to address the physical need for
a clarinet body by using physical modelling in software, yet
still rely on the nuanced reed playing of a human performer.
Their approach facilitates the generation of virtual clarinets
that rely on the existing skills of a clarinet performer. Our
work took the opposite approach, we rely on the software
driving the excitation signal to be the skilled force that
drives a real didgeridoo rather than a skilled performer
playing a virtual didgeridoo.

DESIGN

To help drive the didgeridoo with low frequency tones we
rely heavily on band-pass speaker boxes [2]. These are
passive boxes whose architecture act as a bandpass filter
on the speakers mounted within the box. We rely on the
guidelines for ported bandpass speaker boxes from Vance
Dickason [2].
The overview of the design of the electronically driven
didgeridoo is a ported bandpass speaker box coupled with
a didgeridoo. The intent is to directly couple the speaker
ouput to the didgeridoo with a tight seal forcing the acoustic
energy through the didgeridoo.
While almost any sub-woofer design would be able to
produce the low frequencies required for this application,
a 4th order bandpass design combines a sealed woofer
chamber with a secondary ported chamber such that all
acoustic energy is transmitted via the port. (See Figure 1)
This design yields a physical advantage in that the driver
is completely enclosed and the output from the enclosure
emanates from a port that can be coupled directly to the
instrument.
Since the port must be coupled to the tube, the port
dimension is an important design criterion that must be
chosen in advance. The remainder of the design is then
adjusted to facilitate the chosen port opening.
• Acquire a speaker tuned for and capable of producing
frequencies in the 60hz to 90hz range.
• Given the port opening, calculate the volumes of the
closed box, the ported box, using a 4th order bandpass
calculator [7].
• Build the bandpass box and mount the speaker inside.
• Attach a didgeridoo to the port.
• Configure software to play signals through an appropriate amplifier for the mounted speaker.

3.1

Bandpass boxes

The range of the didgeridoo excitation signal, and the
output of the didgeridoo are quite low, thus sub-woofers,
woofers, and mid-speakers should be used. A professional
player’s excitation signal contains strong components from
about 50Hz up to around 4 kHz. This is a different

requirement from Rogers et al.’s [8] clarinet-like instrument
which used high frequency drivers.
Yet Dickason [2]
describes many different kinds of speaker boxes that address
low frequency response such as bandpass boxes.
Normal use of bandpass speaker as a sub-woofer requires
a crossover to filter out high frequencies. In our case we
connect the amplifier directly to the bandpass speaker as we
want to reproduce as much of the high frequency content as
possible and we are not concerned with the efficiency issues
of traditional subwoofer design.

3.1.1

Box 1

The first box is constructed from raw materials and makes
use of the leftmost design shown in Figure 1. Box 1 is
built from MDF wood and ABS pipe, coupled with an
inexpensive didgeridoo. It was used for performance and
it used a 8 inch diameter mid-range car speaker that had a
free air resonance of 88hz (Pyramid WH8 8-Inch 200 Watt
High Power Paper Cone 8 Ohm Subwoofer). The sealed
box had an interior volume of 13.3 L with dimensions of
25.4cm by 25.4cm by 20.6cm, (10 x 10 x 8.1 inches), and a
ported box with interior volume of 2.5 L with dimensions of
25.4cm by 25.4cm by 3.81cm. (10 x 10 x 1.5 inches). The
port was 5cm (2 inches) in internal diameter and 26.78cm
(10.5 inches) long, cut from 5cm (2 inch) diameter ABS
pipe. The port is longer than all dimensions of the box,
thus it was placed externally to the ported box, like a stovepipe. Theoretically the box output frequencies were tuned
between 51hz and 153hz centered around 88hz.
To cut out this box with 1.9cm (3/4 inch) thick MDF we
recommend cutting out 2 30.48cm (12 inch) by 25.4cm (10
inch) inner side pieces, and 2 30.48cm (12 inch) by 30.48cm
(12 inch) side pieces, 2 30.48cm (12 inch) by 30.48cm (12
inch) end pieces, and 1 25.4cm (10 inch) inner speaker
mount piece. A hole of appropriate size must be cut out
of the inner speaker mount piece to mount the speaker.
The box volumes were calculated using a calculator made
by Raymond et al. [7].
This box was driven by a 1970s solid state Kenwood KA4002 stereo amplifier with 18W per channel, as it was freely
available. The box and the attached didgeridoo are depicted
in Figure 4 in Section 4.

3.1.2

Box 2

Box 2 is an isobaric speaker box made from two modified
commercial speaker enclosures, in our case, the Alesis
Monitor 1. Many commercial speakers can be adapted to
this design which is a simple method for quickly building a
ported bandpass enclosure.

Figure 2: Box 2 Response

The Monitor 1 has a frequency response down to 45 Hz
and uses a 16.5cm woofer which has several properties that
facilitate our design. The woofers are perfectly centered in
the box in its shortest dimension and have a rubber mounting ring that protrudes slightly from the face. Consequently,
when the two speakers are placed face to face, the woofers
are perfectly aligned and the space between them is sealed
in an airtight gap. In order to realize an adequate seal,
one of the two tweeters must be removed. The resulting
opening, however, is sufficiently sealed by the face of the
opposing tweeter which is left in place to provide a barrier
between the two cabinets. We disconnected the wiring of
both tweeters as they are not used in this design.
Each speaker has a rear facing port hole that is slightly
larger than 3.81cm (1.5 inch) PVC pipe. One of these two
ports is sealed shut and the other is coupled to the PVC
pipe via an adapter. The two speakers are then placed
face to face and coupled tightly together using clamps. The
didgeridoo, a PVC pipe of similar bore, is coupled to the
port PVC pipe.
This construction yields an isobaric 4th order bandpass
enclosure. An isobaric enclosure uses two drivers working
in concert as a single driver as shown in the rightmost
diagram of Figure 1. When one driver moves outward,
the other moves inward. To achieve proper operation the
two speakers are wired in opposite polarity and without
crossover networks. An isobaric configuration behaves as a
single driver with a motor that is twice as powerful. This
configuration, however, requires twice the power to produce
the same output [2]. Each speaker is capable of handling
120 Watts at 8 ohms. We power this with a bridged Mackie
1400i capable of producing 1400 Watts at 4 Ohms.
In order to achieve satisfactory response an equalization
curve was applied manually to Box 2. A high shelf boost of
12dB at 2kHz increased the high frequency response and a
sharp notch filter at 1.5kHz was required to null a resonant
peak. Figure 2 shows the corrected response of Box 2 when
driven with a white noise signal. While it is hardly flat
across the spectrum, it gives usable response between 40Hz
and 4kHz.

where f is frequency of lips, a is size of lip opening where
0 ≤ a < a0 , and t is time. Pressure is p0 , and R is the
acoustic resistance of the instrument tube at the resonant
frequency. We keep p0 , R, and a0 constant while we can
vary f and a over t. The output across t is a waveform
of a didgeridoo excitation signal. Note that this does not
replicate vocalization. Vocalization can be added to the
dijj(f, a, t) signal.

Software interface

During the public performance of the didgeridoo we used
a webservice UI that mapped a 2D Hilbert curve to a 2D
scratch-pad. When the scratch-pad was touched or clicked
a didgeridoo tone was initiated, when it was released the
didgeridoo tone was released. The didgeridoo used an
ADSR envelope for triggering with a long release so that
any drone could be sustained or its parameters changed via
mouse or touchscreen control.
Points on the 2D Hilbert curve were mapped to back
to a 1D scalar value and which was then mapped to a
N dimensional Hilbert curve across the parameters of the
synthesizer. This effectively maps 2D inputs to N-D inputs.
In our case we used dimensions such as lip opening (a), lip
frequency (f ), amplitude, frequency modulation, and the
constant value for p0 . This meant that areas on the scratchpad existed that sounded like other areas, but short local
movements would not change the synthesizer parameters
drastically. This enabled a performer to modulate the
didgeridoo synth parameters simply by dragging the cursor.
This helped create more complicated and natural didgeridoo
expressions, as without variation the didgeridoo excitation
is very mechanical, exact, and robotic. This scratch-pad is
inspired by the Sonic Zoom interface proposed by Tubb et
al. [10].

We implemented the excitation signal generator in Pure
Data (Figure 3) and Reaktor (Figure 5) using a function
from Fletcher et al. [3] given by:

LIVE PERFORMANCE

The didgeridoo driven by Box 1 was used in a live performance in January 2017 at Art’s Birthday (celebrating the
birth of the concept of art) in Edmonton, Canada. The
didgeridoo was driven by live improvisation to accompany
a pre-recorded piece of music by Philippe Neau. It was well
received although the didgeridoo had to be micro-phoned

224

However, we also find that the output level varies considerably over the range of useful values of a. Consequently,
we make some attempt to normalize the exciter function by
setting α = (1 − a)2 . This scaling factor yields roughly constant amplitude for a large range of the a parameter. As the
additional harmonics are introduced the overall amplitude
is reduced to compensate for the increased spectral content.

5.2

wooden didgeridoo

to amplify its signal in the large room. Figure 4 shows the
performer sitting down controlling the didgeridoo attached
to Box 1 sitting beside him. The performer utilized a 2D
scratch-pad, described in Section 3.3.
One audience member, a didgeridoo player, suggested
employing more vocalizations and attaching a microphone
to the device. Possible improvements in performance could
be attained by using a more powerful amplifier to drive the
speaker, as well as employing lip opening envelopes rather
than straight ADSR envelopes. One concern was with how
simple or robotic the didgeridoo sounded. We concluded
that adding low amplitude noise to many of the parameters
such as frequency f and lip opening a would improve the
naturalness of the didgeridoo sound.

5.

IMPROVED EXCITER

In an effort to combat robotic performances we acted upon
feedback from the performance to modify Fletcher’s [3]
exciter to produce signals closer to real didgeridoo players.
Fletcher et al. describe their model as a simplified model
of a lip valve [3]. We compare its spectrum with the
specturm of our normalized version of the simplified model.
When the parameter a is close to zero, the output of the
exciter has few harmonics. As the parameter approaches 1
the harmonic content increases dramatically. Although the
intensity of the harmonics increases with parameter a, this
model replicates very little of the higher formants typical of
human didgeridoo players.
We also observe that the basic exciter implementation has
far less variation than the exciter of the human didgeridoo
player. Moreover, the high frequencies roll off sharply after
1kHz.

Vowel like sounds

In addition to variation in the lip movement, the tongue and
throat contribute significantly to the sound of the didgeridoo. While modelling the tongue and throat accurately is
beyond the scope of this work, we added a third LFO to
add some harmonic colour.
This LFO primarily modulates the frequency of the exciter and thus,in addition to providing additional harmonic
content, it also replaces the function of the LFO in the Pure
Data implementation.
Rather than a straightforward sine wave oscillator, we
use a formant oscillator which allows the formant frequency
of the oscillator to be adjusted independently of the base
frequency. This LFO also modulates the a parameter thus
simulating that a change in frequency will also cause the lip
opening to change. The base frequency is fixed as a multiple
of the fundamental frequency. The formant frequencies are
user controllable and add a simulation of vowel-like sounds
to the basic sound of the exciter.

5.4

Spit sounds

A small amount of coloured noise is added to the output
to simulate the wind and spit sounds that a real didgeridoo
player will produce. The noise amplitude is modulated by
the output of the exciter to simulate the motorboat like
properties of a didgeridoo player’s lips. The user is able to
control the noise colour and the level of noise added to the
output.

6.

Improved exciter design

To improve the realism of the simulated didgeridoo we
extended the original exciter model. This second exciter was
implemented in Reaktor [6], as seen in Figure 5. Our first
improvement was to simplify the exciter for fixed pressure
and tube impedance and to normalize the output somewhat.
Since we are holding p0 , R, and a0 constant we make
some simplifications. We observe that this function will
have a DC offset that must be removed with a high-pass
filter, consequently, the value of these constants when fixed
is arbitrary and, setting α = −1, we can simplify the exciter
as follows.

Robotic sound

In the Pure Data implementation we modulated the exciter
function with a sine wave low frequency oscillator (LFO), in
order to modulate the drone frequency. While this allowed
some variation in frequency and tone it was insufficient to
avoid a robotic sound.
We observe that real players do not maintain a constant
frequency or amplitude but have small perturbations in
these parameters while playing. In our improved exciter we
use two random waveform LFOs to simulate the variation
expected in a human player’s lip opening while playing. The
two LFOs operate at frequencies 0.1 · f and 0.01 · f labelled
fast and slow respectively. Each has player controlled
amplitudes. These LFOs output a random waveform that
simulates Brownian motion.

FUTURE WORK

While our improved exciter addressed many of the issues of
a robotic sounding performance, more can be done. Adding
noise worked well for the improved exciter, thus perhaps
adding reverb could help simulate a didgeridoo born of a
termite infested branch. This reverb could simulate a less
than smooth bore.
Another area of improvement is to address the model of
the human player. We did not have good measures of lip
opening, pressure, or frequency of excitation, furthermore
much of our aim was emulate didgeridoo playing and thus
all of the sounds one can make with a didgeridoo. Future
work can involve searching a space of parameters that
change across time in order to find the parameter timeseries
that could produce other characteristic didgeridoo sounds

such as dingo barks [4]. Rather than manually reverse
engineer how a didgeridoo sound is made we could use
search algorithms to tune the parameters of our exciter
to find series of parameters that would produce didgeridoo
sounds.
Alternatively we can use a microphone to simulate driving
a didgeridoo with our own mouth whether by enveloping the
excitation signal or by layering microphone vocals into the
excitation signal to simulate vocalizing with a didgeridoo.
Fletcher [3] has shown that many vocalizations are not from
the lips but from the vocal chords and are overlaid on the
lip buzzing signal.

7.

CONCLUSIONS

We have described a method of utilizing ported bandpass
speaker boxes to electronically drive didgeridoos, effectively making an electro-acoustic didgeridoo. This kind of
didgeridoo faces serious energy/amplification constraints
that other electronically excited wind instruments do not
as lower frequency response requires larger speakers driven
by powerful amplifiers—similar to speakers and amplifiers
used in hobbyist car stereos. Using the work of Fletcher et
al. [3], the speakers produce a didgeridoo excitation signal
meant to mimic the buzzing of a performer’s lips. This
signal drives a didgeridoo and produces sounds similar to a
didgeridoo performer’s music.
We found that if frequency, and lip opening are not
carefully modulated, whether manually or by Brownian
motion, the didgeridoo will sound robotic. Adding further
modulation and noise can produce more natural didgeridoo
sounds, yet it is clear there is a lot of future work to be
done in intentionally emulating many forms of didgeridoo
expressions as well as finding appropriate user interfaces to
control the didgeridoo. 1
